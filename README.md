# Drawing

Java application with the main class including a constructor without parameters in which a drawing is generated. I used the Shapes application classes, one of the applications in the Examples directory in BlueJ. The class has 5 state variables: 3 Circle type variables, two Triangle type variables and three Square type variables.
